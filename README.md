# Donation Form Notes

 - Timer has been set to always show 4 days out for demo purposes. It can also accept a date string like "May 21, 2023" as props instead.
 - The react-currency-input-field library was used for the input since it has some nice validation features out of the box. Also included (but not used) is a VanillaForm component that uses a standard input with a custom validation function instead for a zero-dependency approach.
 - zustand is used for state management.
